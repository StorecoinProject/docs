title: Horizon Reference Overview
---
Horizon is the client-facing API server for the Storecoin ecosystem.  It acts as the interface between [Storecoin Core](https://github.com/Storecoin/Storecoin) and applications that want to access the Storecoin network. Horizon allows you to submit transactions to the network, check the status of accounts, and subscribe to event streams. For more details, see an [overview of the Storecoin network](https://www.Storecoin.org/developers/guides/).

You can interact directly with Horizon via cURL or a web browser. Storecoin also provides a [JavaScript SDK](https://www.Storecoin.org/developers/js-Storecoin/learn/) for clients to use to interact with Horizon.

Storecoin.org runs an [instance of Horizon](https://horizon-testnet.Storecoin.org/) that is connected to the testnet.
